# Global AI Workflow & Knowledge Architecture

This repository is the canonical source of truth for:
- Global AI memory and rules
- Prompt library
- Workflow and process documentation
- Secret registry metadata (no secret values)
- Project-level documentation and structure

## Key Directories

- `global-memory/` — global rules, standards, processes, tool usage
- `prompts/` — global prompt library (with metadata in `index.json`)
- `docs/` — global workflow and prompt-engineering guides
- `infra/secrets/` — secret registry and policies (no values)
- `projects/` — per-project docs, prompts, source, tests

GitHub is canonical. SharePoint mirrors selected docs as read-only.
