 # 🛠 Tool Usage Rules (AI & Dev Tools)

Defines how AI tools and development tools should be used globally.

## 1. AI Assistants (ChatGPT, Codex, Atlas, etc.)

- Always reference:
   - `global-memory/memory.md`
   - `global-memory/standards.md`
   - `global-memory/processes.md`
 - For project work, additionally reference:
   - `/projects/<project-name>/docs/`

## 2. Behavioural Rules for AI Tools

- Never invent or store secrets.
- Call out uncertainty and suggest verification steps.
- When modifying code or docs:
   - Propose complete changes.
   - Avoid destructive actions (no blind deletes).

## 3. Knowledge Integration

- Prefer official documentation (vendor docs, standards).
- Summarise and cite key external sources in project docs.
 - Promote reusable knowledge from projects into `global-memory/` as needed.
