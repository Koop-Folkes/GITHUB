 # 🌐 Global Memory

This file defines global, long-lived organisational truths used by all AI tools.

## 1. Purpose

- Provide a single, canonical place for global rules and knowledge.
- Be referenced by ChatGPT, Codex, Atlas, CI, and any other AI tooling.
- Avoid scattering “remember this” across chats and tools.

## 2. Global Rules (Examples – customise)

- GitHub is the canonical knowledge base; SharePoint is a read-only mirror.
- No secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials are ever stored in:
   - Code
   - Prompts
   - Markdown docs
   - Chat logs
 - All process changes go through PRs on this repo.

## 3. Key References

- `global-memory/standards.md`
- `global-memory/processes.md`
- `global-memory/tools.md`
 - `docs/workflow.md`
 - `docs/prompting.md`

 Extend this file over time with:
 - Permanent decisions
 - Global constraints
 - Company-wide conventions
