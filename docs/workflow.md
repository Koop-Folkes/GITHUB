 # 🌐 Global AI Workflow Model

This document defines the standard lifecycle to be reused across projects.

## 1. Phases

1. Ideation & Planning
2. Design
3. Prototyping
4. Development
5. Testing & QA
6. Deployment
7. Documentation & Training

Projects may extend or specialise this in `/projects/<name>/docs/workflow.md`.

## 2. Phase Overview (High-Level)

- **Ideation & Planning** — clarify goals, constraints, and stakeholders.
- **Design** — UX, technical design, architecture, and interfaces.
- **Prototyping** — rapid validation of approach and core flows.
- **Development** — feature implementation, refactor, and hardening.
- **Testing & QA** — automated + manual, including non-functional.
- **Deployment** — packaging, rollout, monitoring setup.
- **Documentation & Training** — user docs, runbooks, onboarding material.

## 3. Governance

- This file is global. Projects inherit from it and may specialise locally.
- Any change here should be considered a cross-project process change.
